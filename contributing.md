### Making a Build

To make a build of the distributables into `dist/` in the cloned repository run

```
npm install
node build
```

### Running the tests

Tests can run in the browser by opening a webserver and visiting the `test.html` page.
Automated tests that run the tests from the command line in Firefox can be run with

```
npm test
```
